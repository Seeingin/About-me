# Hi! I'm Aleksandra.

I decided to change my focus from management to data analytics to expand my decision-making toolkit. In my work I use communication skills, critical and analytical thinking together with SQL, Python and other tools to find hidden patterns in data, identify influencing factors on business metrics and find points of growth.

I'm developing in data analytics, improving my skills - learning statistics, Python, SQL, data visualization and ML tools.
